            <b>Pythalmala</b>, also called Vaithalmala, is a hill station situated in the Kannur region of Kerala. Snuggled in the Western Ghats, the trek takes you through dense forests and opens up to a wide expanse that goes to the Pythalmala peak. 
            Located near Pottenplave village, at a height of 1372 m above sea level, this is the highest geographic peak in Kannur. It is located at 40 km from Taliparamba and 65 km from Kannur. Nestled in the Kerala Karnataka border near to Kodagu forests, it lies in the Western Ghats. It has become a favourite spot for the nature enthusiasts, photographers, trekkers and leisurely visitors. 
            There are two trekking seasons at Paithalmala, falling in monsoon and summer. Monsoon (June to October) trekking to Paithalmala is a photographer's delight as the mist blankets the hills and forest. 
            Nearest Airport is the Kannur International Airport. Distance travel to reach the destination is 45 km via NH66.

            <b>St. Angelo Fort</b> (also known as Kannur Fort or Kannur Kotta) is a fort facing the Arabian Sea, situated 3 km from Kannur, a city in Kerala state, south India. 
            This massive triangular laterite structure is flanked by gigantic bastions that make for an imposing sight. It changed hands between the Dutch and eventually the British, who would remodel and reequip it into their primary military stronghold in Malabar. 
            Mopilla Bay and Dharamadam Island are among the primary attractions here. Mopilla Bay is a natural harbour and the fort offers a wonderful view of it along with a sea wall projecting from the fort separating the rough sea and inland water. 
            Dharamadam Island, barely 5 acres in area, is 100 m from the mainland and a favourite haunt of tourists. People come to the fort for relaxing strolls and just a brilliant view of the Arabian Sea. 
            Nearest airport is Kannur International Airport, about 35 km away.

            <b>Muzhappilangad Drive-in Beach</b> (5.5 km length) is a beach on the Malabar Coast in the state of Kerala in southwestern India. It is located parallel to National Highway 66 (formerly National Highway 17) between Kannur and Thalassery. 
            This beach is the longest Drive-In Beach in Asia and is featured among the top 6 best beaches for driving in the world in BBC article for Autos. Muzhappilangad is the only Asian beach featured in the list. Even though Goa has many beautiful beaches, it does not have a Drive-in beach. It is considered as the longest drive-in beach in Asia. 
            There is an unpaved road winding through coconut groves leading to the beach. To get to this road, if you are driving from Tellicherry towards Kannur, take the left turn just before the first railway crossing you encounter after crossing the Moidu bridge. 
            Kannur International Airport is 5.7 km away.
