            <b>Silent Valley National Park</b> is believed to be the sole surviving bit of evergreen forest in the Sahya Ranges. The peculiarity of the Silent Valley Forest is that it is even devoid of the chirping of cicadas’. Vehicular transport is possible only up to Mukkali, nearly 24 km from the park. 
            The rest of the way has to be covered by foot, up to the source of Kunthipuzha, which flows through the valley before merging into the Bharathapuzha River. The closest to a virgin forest in the entire Western Ghats, the Silent Valley National Park is home to India’s last substantial stretch of tropical evergreen forests. It’s difficult terrain and remoteness shelters a large number of wild animals. 
            Silent Valley gets copious amounts of rainfall during the monsoons, but the actual amount varies within the region due to the varied topography. 
            It was the British who coined the name 'Silent Valley' because of a perceived absence of noisy Cicadas. 
            The national park is one of the last undisturbed tracts of South Western Ghats mountain rain forests and tropical moist evergreen forest in India.

            <b>Palakkad Fort</b> is the old fort situated in the very heart of Palakkad town is one of the best preserved in Kerala. It was built by Hyder Ali of Mysore in 1766 and later taken over and modified by the British in 1790. It is now preserved by Archeological Survey of India. 
            A temple of Lord Hanuman is adjacent to the main entrance of the Fort. A museum of Archeology is also functioning inside the Fort.Fort is surrounded by a moat. A jogging track parallel to the moat is provided for jogging in the morning and evening hours. The entire area is beautifully landscaped. 
            The Palakkad Fort is said to have existed from very ancient times but believed to be constructed in the present form in 1766 A.D, but little is known of its early history. 
            There is a large ground between the Fort and the Palakkad Townhall, known as Kota Maidanam. The ground is now used to stage cricket matches, exhibitions, and public meetings. An open-air auditorium called "Rappadi", currently under the preservation of the Archeological Survey of India, is also located within the spacious grounds of the Fort.
