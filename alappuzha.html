            <b>Marari beach</b> which is one of the great delights of the Malabar Coast, is an idyllic serene beach. About 11 km from the city of Alleppey, this beach is a hotspot for fishing activity, deriving its name from the local fishing village Mararikulam. 
            Visiting in August gives tourists the exclusive opportunity to view Snake Boat races across the waters. The serenity and quietude on the beach are beyond description, so much so that Marari Beach has been enlisted among the top five hammock beaches of the world by National Geographic Survey. 
            The beach is around 16 kms from the town of Alappuzha. Also, the nearest railway station is Marari which is 5 kms from the beach. 
            Marari Beach is being increasingly preferred by travellers as an alternative to its more popular counterpart- Kovalam in the South.

            <b>Ambalapuzha Sree Krishna Temple</b> is a Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Krishna situated in Alappuzha district. Built-in the traditional Kerala style architectural pattern, the temple is famous for its delicious rice pudding prepared in sweet milk, popularly known as Pal Payasam. 
            The idol at Ambalapuzha is likened to Parthasarthi form of Vishnu, holding a whip in his right hand and a conch in his left. During the raids of Tipu Sultan in 1789, the idol of Sri Krishna from the Guruvayoor Temple was brought to the Ambalappuzha Temple for safe keeping for 12 years. 
            The temple is located 14 kms south of the town of Alappuzha in Ambalapuzha on the NH 47. 
            This shrine highlights Kerala style of architecture and is noted for its Chuttambalam, that is adorned with beautiful wall paintings.

            <b>The Krishnapuram Palace</b> is a palace and museum located in Kayamkulam near Alappuzha in Alappuzha district, Kerala in southwestern India. It was built in the 18th century by Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma (1729â€“1758 AD), the Travancore kingdom. It is built in the architectural style of Kerala with gabled roof, narrow corridor and dormer windows, near the Krishnaswamy Temple at Krishnapuram. 
            The palace is maintained by the Kerala State Department of Archaeology and contains exhibits that belonged to the Palace and its former occupant, the Travancore Maharaja Marthanda Varma. It is also famous for a large pond within the palace complex. It is also said that an underground escape route runs from the bottom of the pond as a possible escape route from enemies.
