Situated at 1,048 metres (3,438 ft) above mean sea level, Ranipuram is 48 km from the nearest city Kanhangad and 107 km from the major port city of Mangalore. 
            The gentle hills of Ranipuram in Kerala are famous for its trekking trail.

            The sublime beauty of this region is comparable to that of Ooty, and is a must-visit for all nature enthusiasts. The innocent life of the village and gentle nature make a perfect blend of delight and enjoyment.

            <b>Bekal Fort</b> was built by Shivappa Nayaka of Keladi in 1650 AD, at Bekal. It is the largest fort in Kerala, spreading over 40 acres (160,000 m2). 
            The fort appears to emerge from the sea. Almost three-quarters of its exterior is in contact with water. Bekal fort was not an administrative centre and does not include any palaces or mansions. 
            An important feature is the water-tank, magazine and the flight of steps leading to an observation tower built by Tipu Sultan. Standing at the centre of the fort, this offers views of the coastline and the towns of Kanhangad, Pallikkara, Bekal, Mavval, Kottikkulam, and Uduma. 
            The fort's zigzag entrance and surrounding trenches reveal its defensive strategy. Holes on the outer walls are designed to defend the fort effectively from naval attacks. The upper holes meant for aiming at the farthest targets; lower holes below for striking as enemy nearer and the lowest holes to attacking enemy closest to the fort.
